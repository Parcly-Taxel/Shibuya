**Shibuya** is a utility for drawing graphs, with a particular focus on integral embeddings in the plane (which every graph has) and unit-distance embeddings (which not all graphs have).

This project started in my [Dounreay](https://gitlab.com/parclytaxel/Dounreay) "incubator" repository, initially just for exploration into integral graphs. I managed to find a unit-distance embedding of the Foster graph, but that was essentially all I found out on my own. After a question by Ed Pegg regarding the _rigidity_ of a certain unit-distance graph – [I answered it, showing it was rigid](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3955860/357390) – I realised that keeping the relevant files in Dounreay would be too much of a hassle, so I split them off here.

The name recalls that of another of my repositories dealing heavily with "networks", [Shinjuku](https://gitlab.com/parclytaxel/Shinjuku). Shibuya Station is the second-busiest train station in the world, behind Shinjuku.
